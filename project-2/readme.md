<h1> Instructable Readme Part 1 <h1>

This project is pretty difficult!
Spent a lot of time trying to memorize the tags
Had (still having) a few issues with the page that I need help
figuring out!
The font seems to all be the same size which sucks.
I managed to fix the list, previously it was all one paragraph with dots
in the middle and now its actually a list
Feels good though to be making progress with coding.
Managed to get all the source code thus far done in about 3 hours!!!
GO ME!
