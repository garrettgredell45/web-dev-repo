<h1>Assignment 3: Pages</h1>
<br>
<h5>How many head and body elements can a page have?</h5>
<p> A page can have multiple head and body elements and function HOWEVER, it is frowned upon because it is disorganized and can lead to issues in the code. The head element is the place where metadada (data about data) is stored. This kind of data is not displayed on the website. The body tag defines any of the "meat" of the document. This data IS visible.
<h5>Describe the differences between structural and semantic markup</h5>
<u>structural:</u> elements that can be used to describe both headings and paragraphs
<br><u>Semantic:</u> Provides semantics, like emphasis, quotes, etc. Generally helps to convey information that a user is reading in a comprehensive way.
  <h5>Summarize your work structure for this assignment</h5>
For this assignment I just took it one step at a time. I was admittedly pretty confused with linking pages and all the "a" tags but towards the end it felt a lot clearer. I still am having trouble linking from the crust page back to the home page but I can link from the home page to the crust page easily. I'm sure it has something to do with how I referenced the file.
