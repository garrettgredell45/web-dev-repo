<h1>Asignment 4: Forms</h1>
<p>Alt Text- a written element that is displayed, describing in specific detail what an image is should it fail to load for some reason. It's a good tool for accessibility.</p>
<h2>Examples of Forms I've encountered:</h2>
<ul>
<li>selecting info for residency</li>
<li>payment info for online purchases</li>
<li>Any sort of online survey</li>
</ul>
<h2>Work Cycle:</h2>
<p>I spent most of my time on this project trying to organize how I wanted to convey the information that would be in the forms portion of the page. There were seemingly quite a few ways to utilize all the form options to create a cohesive page. I used inspiration from actual camp registration sites (for layout) and tried to implement their ideas into this project. It definitely helped to have some sort of organized idea of what I wanted and likely saved me some time in the long run.</p>
