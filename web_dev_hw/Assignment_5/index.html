      <h1>Song Lyrics</h1>
      <p1>
        <p>When I was a young boy
        My father took me into the city
        To see a marching band
        He said, son, when you grow up
        Would you be the savior of the broken
        The beaten, and the damned?</p>
        <p>He said, will you defeat them
        Your demons and all the non-believers?
        The plans that they have made?
        Because one day I'll leave you
        A phantom to lead you in the summer
        To join the black parade</p>
        <p>When I was a young boy
        My father took me into the city
        To see a marching band
        He said, son, when you grow up
        You will be the savior of the broken
        The beaten, and the damned?</p>
        <p>Sometimes I get the feeling
        She's watching over me
        And other times I feel like I should go</p>
        <p>And through it all
        The rise and fall
        The bodies in the streets
        And when you're gone, we want you all to know</p>
        <p>We'll carry on, we'll carry on
        And though you're dead and gone, believe me
        Your memory will carry on
        We'll carry on</p>
        <p>And in my heart I can't contain it
        The anthem won't explain it</p>
        <p>A world that sends you reeling
        From decimated dreams
        Your misery and hate will kill us all
        So paint it black
        And take it back
        Let's shout it loud and clear
        Defiant to the end
        We hear the call</p>
        <p>To carry on
        We'll carry on
        And though you're dead and gone, believe me
        Your memory will carry on
        We'll carry on
        And though you're broken and defeated
        Your weary widow marches</p>
        <p>On and on, we carry through the fears
        (Oh, oh, oh)
        Disappointed faces of your peers
        (Oh, oh, oh)
        Take a look at me
        'Cause I could not care at all</p>
        <p>Do or die
        You'll never make me
        Because the world
        Will never take my heart
        You can try
        You'll never break me
        We wanna all
        We want to play this part
        Won't explain
        Or say I'm sorry
        I'm unashamed
        I'm gonna show my scar
        Give a cheer
        For all the broken
        Listen here
        Because it's who we are
        I'm just a man
        I'm not a hero
        Just a boy who had to sing this song
        I'm just a man
        I'm not a hero
        I don't care</p>
        <p>We'll carry on
        We'll carry on
        And though your dead and gone, believe me
        Your memory will carry on
        We'll carry on
        And though you're broken and defeated
        Your weary widow marches on</p>
        <p>Do or die
        You'll never make me
        Because the world
        Will never take my heart
        You can try
        You'll never break me
        We wanna know
        We want to play this part
        Do or die (we'll carry on)
        You'll never make me (we'll carry on)
        Because the world (we'll carry on)
        Will never take my heart
        You can try
        You'll never break me
        We wanna all
        We want to play this part (we'll carry on)</p>
